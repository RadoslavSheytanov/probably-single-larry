# CLAUDE.md — Singularis PWA

## Project Overview
Singularis is a professional-grade Progressive Web App for performing mentalists. It computes a spectator's date of birth and star sign from two secretly inputted numbers. The app has a clean Home dashboard for setup/practice, and a pure-black Performance Mode screen where the performer inputs numbers blind with the phone in their pocket. Results are pushed to the performer's smartwatch via ntfy.sh. No decoy calculator — the stealth is in how the phone is used, not what it looks like.

## Tech Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite 7 (build tool, dev server, PWA plugin)
- Tailwind CSS 4 via @tailwindcss/vite (CSS-first config, @theme in index.css)
- Framer Motion 11 (animations, gesture recognition, spring physics)
- vite-plugin-pwa (Workbox-powered service worker generation)
- ntfy.sh (push notifications, no self-hosted server)
- No backend. No database. No API keys. Entirely client-side.

## Development Environment
- OS: Fedora Linux (no macOS, no Xcode — this is a PWA, not native)
- Node.js 20+ via nvm
- Package manager: npm
- Browser for testing: Google Chrome / Chromium (required for Speech API)
- Editor: any (Claude Code handles file creation)
- On first run, Claude Code must check and install all prerequisites:
  - Node.js 20+ (via nvm if not present)
  - git
  - Google Chrome or Chromium
  - Global npm packages: javascript-obfuscator, serve

## Commands
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview production: `npm run preview`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Type check: `npm run typecheck`

## Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- Functional components only, no class components
- Zustand for state management (single store, no prop drilling)
- Framer Motion for ALL animations (no CSS transitions/keyframes except Tailwind defaults)
- Tailwind for ALL styling (no inline styles, no CSS modules, no styled-components)
- Custom hooks extract complex logic from components
- Each component file < 150 lines. If longer, split it.
- Engine logic has 100% unit test coverage

## Design Philosophy
- HOME DASHBOARD: Clean dark surface (#0a0a0a) with all features accessible. Singularis branding visible here.
- PERFORMANCE MODE: Pure #000000. Phone in pocket. Blind input. Zero UI except subtle phase dots + faint number.
- WATCH IS THE PEEK: ntfy → smartwatch is the primary output. ResultPeek screen is a visual fallback only.
- PROFESSIONAL: This is a working tool for paid performers.
- OFFLINE-FIRST: Full functionality without internet (except ntfy push).
- ZERO COGNITIVE LOAD: Performer inputs numbers blind, phone in pocket. Top zone = +10, bottom = +1.

## Critical Rules
- NEVER add console.log in committed code
- NEVER use localStorage for anything except the license key
- ALWAYS validate computed dates before rendering
- NEVER expose the formula in readable source — wrap in obfuscated IIFE for prod
- PWA name is "Calculator" (stealth at OS/device level). App branding "Singularis" visible only inside Home screen.
- All touch handlers MUST call e.preventDefault() to block browser defaults
- Test every change against the reference case: A=24, D=10 → July 17, Cancer ♋

## Ambiguous Resolution (in-pocket, blind)
- On ambiguous result: haptic warning pattern → ntfy fires with BOTH dates
- Black screen stays active, top/bottom zones now select the date:
  - TOP tap = earlier date in calendar year
  - BOTTOM tap = later date in calendar year
- After tap: second ntfy fires with confirmed single date
- Phase indicator shows RESOLVING (4th state) during this window

## Current State
### Complete
- Phase 0: Environment setup (Node 24, Chrome 145, git, javascript-obfuscator, serve)
- Phase 1: Scaffold + engine
  - Vite 7 + React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind v4, PWA config, Terser
  - src/engine/singularis.ts — full formula with all validation
  - src/engine/starsigns.ts — complete zodiac lookup
  - src/engine/engine.test.ts — 30/30 tests passing
  - src/utils/types.ts, src/utils/constants.ts
- Phase 2: State, home screen, stealth input, app router
  - src/state/store.ts — full Zustand store (navigation, stealth phases, history, settings)
  - src/screens/Home.tsx — dashboard with Start Performance, Practice, History, Settings
  - src/screens/StealthInput.tsx — black screen, invisible zones, RESOLVING ambiguous state
  - src/hooks/useStealthInput.ts — all gestures + keyboard shortcuts
  - src/components/PhaseIndicator.tsx — 4-state dots
  - src/services/haptics.ts — all 6 vibration patterns
  - src/App.tsx — AnimatePresence screen router
- Phase 3: Result screen, output channels
  - src/services/ntfy.ts — push to ntfy.sh (fires twice on ambiguous)
  - src/services/ics.ts — .ics calendar file generation + download
  - src/services/wakeLock.ts — screen wake lock with visibility re-acquire
  - src/components/WatchPreview.tsx — slide-in watch card, auto-dismisses after 5s
  - src/screens/ResultPeek.tsx — animated result reveal, save to calendar, new reading

### Remaining
- Phase 4: Settings panel, History panel, PracticeMode
- Phase 5: Voice input (Web Speech API)
- Phase 6: PWA polish, icons, keyboard shortcuts
- Phase 7: License gate, anti-debugging, domain lock, obfuscation

### Key Decisions Made
- No Decoy Calculator — app has a Home dashboard instead
- Performance mode = pure black screen, phone always in pocket
- ntfy → watch is the primary output channel; ResultPeek is visual fallback
- Ambiguous: ntfy fires twice (both options first, then confirmed after tap resolution)
- Top zone tap = earlier calendar date; Bottom zone tap = later calendar date
- Phase indicator has 4 states: ANCHOR → DIFFERENCE → COMPUTED → RESOLVING
- Git: develop branch for all work; main kept clean for final PR merge
